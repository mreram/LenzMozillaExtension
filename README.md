## Contribution :collision:

Pull requests are welcome! :clap:

You can improve/fix some part of it.

Add Tests:

Assuming that the code in question already has automated (unit) tests, do add tests for the code you submit.

This isn't a hard rule. There are various cases where you may need to add code without test coverage (e.g. when adding a Object), but if it can be tested, it should be tested.
